# VSCode symbols provider for ther Dafny language

This extension provides support for collecting symbols in Dafny programs (variables, functions, lemmas).

## Features

Symbols can be obtained via the command pallette command-shift-O and used to populate the outline panel.


## Known Issues

Nested comments may not be skipped and their content (symbols) may be indexed. 

## Improvements

Hierarchical view would be nice using the DocumentSymbol type instead of SymbolInformation.
Newicons to identify logical/proof components would probably help.

## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.

### 1.0.0

Initial release of this extension
